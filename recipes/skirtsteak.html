    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This skirt steak recipe is quick and easy to put together and only needs to marinade for 30 minutes. The perfect solution when you lose track of time and need to put something on the table in a hurry!</p>
      <p>It is best if you have a grill capable of reaching higher temperatures of 600+ degrees - perhaps with a sear option - so that the honey carmelizes on the outside. Most grill recipes I use rely on temperature, but I found it is best to just follow a general time of 2-3 minutes per side. You may need to practice a few times to get it right!</p>

Foundations course project 1

In this exercise, I applied a set of skills I learned in the previous lessons. I made best efforts to rely on memory to perform all the operations without referencing any material. 

I have prior experience with html and websites, so I did not learn much new information for html programming, but was able to leverage my new skills on the command line and git to perform a lot of new operations that made setting up the website a lot easier. I will continue to use my terminal and git techniques and hope to get more comfortable working on the command line.
